        <p>
             I used to love playing video games(particularly zombie games). I'v always<br />
        wanted to make a zombie game so when im bored i think of a story line or learn<br />
        to program. I went to Don Bosco Tech for summer school and learned some html.<br />
        I learned a decent amount of programming for beginning. My Cousin is a <br />
        programmer so I learned how to do some more, but since he lived in Texas<br />
        he had to teach me as much as he can in one day at California. I learned <br />
        how to use BootStrap when i was with him though. Now I am in Don Bosco <br />
        and trying to be the best possible.I now want to learn making games ,because <br />
        it has always interested me and I always think I can make a better game than<br />
        some that are out right now.
